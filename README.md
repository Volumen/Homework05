The application retrieves the current exchange rate. The game draws one currency and you have to guess its value in PLN. If you have given too little value, the application will say "too little", if you have given too much, the application will tell you "too much". Currency values are rounded to two decimal places. After winning you will find out how many tries you needed to guess the value.
